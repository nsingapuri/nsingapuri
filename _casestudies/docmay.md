Dr. Erin May, a veterinarian who does a combination of in-home house calls and zoom consultations for pets, needed a more efficient way to manage her growing caseload. I was able to help her optimize her operations without breaking the bank, and delivered a lightweight, custom software solution tailored to her unique needs.

At the core of the system is a static Jekyll website integrated with Fillout forms, which seamlessly collect leads and appointment requests from pet owners. I extended this setup with a lightweight layer of automatons to block off and invoice for travel time, allowing Dr. May to batch and route her visits more logically across the San Antonio area and provide her customers transparent pricing. This hybrid approach not only saved her time and fuel, but also reduced stress and increased customer satisfaction. The result is a nimble, reliable tool that empowers Dr. May to spend less time schedulingâ€”and more time offering care and comfort to pets in need.
