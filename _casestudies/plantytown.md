PlantyTown began not as a grand business venture, but as a solution to a personal problem. I'd amassed a collection of rare and exotic plants — more than my home could easily accommodate . What started as an effort to offload a few treasured specimens quickly grew into a thriving online market for plant enthusiasts seeking hard-to-find greenery.

Launched as a niche website with a selection of species catering to collectors, PlantyTown gained early traction thanks to my careful curation. Each plant was treated like a work of art, complete with detailed care instructions and provenance. The site built a loyal following.

However, as demand has grown, so have the operational challenges. Warehousing and shipping delicate living items has proved increasingly complex. Fragile foliage doesn’t fare well in transit, and the logistical headaches around climate control, packaging, and perishability became less sustainable at scale.

Recognizing the limitations of warehousing and shipping perishables, I've began to pivot. PlantyTown has gradually expanded its offerings into jewelry, accessories, and home decor. These are areas that naturally complemented its botanical roots. Today, the site features a growing selection of leafs cast in silver and gold, t-shirts, home decor, and other thoughtfully curated accessories.

Though it now carries fewer plants than it once did, Planty Town retains the spirit of its origin—an eye for beauty, a love for nature, and a personal touch that sets it apart. What began as a personal plant collection has evolved into a lifestyle brand that brings a sense of calm, green-inspired design into homes everywhere.
