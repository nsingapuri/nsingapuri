BoneNE evolved from running the Museum of Jewelrys social media. Often I would post images of historic jewelry that I found interesting but which was unrelated to their line, and in the comments folks would beg that we create a replica. Making jewelry sounded fun, so I partnered with Museum of Jewelry to fabricate these pieces. Often product offerings were focused on SEO, for example improving ranking for Egyptian jewelry by offering a greater selection.

As the company grew I partnered with Museum gift shops in order to replicate actual pieces on display in their collections.

Ultimately I found manufacturing historic jewelry to be fun but a bit of a niche market, I keep the business open as it has a lot of inventory and it helps pay the bills but BoneNE has scaled in a manner that is a bit disappointing.
